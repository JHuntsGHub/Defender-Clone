# Defender Clone
*A clone of the classic arcade game from the 80's - Defender, by Jack Hunt.*  

## The Game
The player goes up against many waves of ever-increasing difficulty.

### The Player
* Moves around with the arrow keys.
* Fires a laser with space or the 'A' key.
* Launches a bomb that destroys all enemies on screen with the 'S' key.
* Activates the hyperdrive which teleports the player to a random location with the 'X' key.
* The player character can also be controlled with an Xbox controller.

### The Scientists
* There are several scientists at the bottom of the screen.
* It is the player's objective to keep these scientists from being abducted.
* If all scientists are lost, the planet explodes!

### The Enemies
* Lander - The most common enemy that occasionally shoots at the player. They try to abduct the scientists; when successful, they drag the scientists up to space where they combine into Mutants.
* Mutants - A more a aggressive strain on lander that actively chase down and shoot at the player.
* Bomber - A relatively passive enemy that spawns some bombs around the map.
* Baiter - A rare but very dangerous enemy. They try to crash into the player at very high speeds.
* Mothership - An uncommon enemy that spawns some Swarmers. Upon death, spawns between 5 - 7 Swarmers.
* Swarmer - A small enemy that tries to crash into the player.

## Current State of Project
The project has been finished and I have moved on to another. I copied the repository here to be public for use in my portfolio.
